# FactSaura: Agentic AI Swarm for Crisis Misinformation Defense
## "When Crisis Strikes, Truth Can't Wait" - Autonomous AI agents hunt misinformation 24/7

**Team FactSaura → MumbaiHacks 2025 | 4-Hour Sprint Challenge**

## 🚨 THE CRISIS WE'RE SOLVING

**In Mumbai Floods, Lies Kill Faster Than Water**
- Speed Crisis: Misinformation spreads 6x faster than truth during emergencies
- Real Deaths: 800+ people died from COVID fake cures, countless more from crisis misinformation
- Mumbai Reality: During floods, false evacuation routes and fake rescue numbers cause panic and deaths
- No Defense: People see dangerous lies but can't warn their community fast enough
- Cost Barrier: Professional fact-checking costs ₹65K-2.5L/month - communities can't afford protection

**That's why we built FactSaura — the world's first agentic AI swarm that hunts misinformation before it kills.**
